;; Problem 4

;; Consider the following data definition:

(define-struct person [name parent1 parent2])
;; A Person is one of:
;; - #false
;; - (make-person String Person Person)
;; Interpretation:  A person's name and two biological parents.
;; Or a sentinel value representing that a person's identity/lineage is not 
;; known.

    [(boolean? p) ...]
    [(person? p)
     (... (person-name p) ...

;; Design a function called remove-ancestors that receives a Person and a
;; list of names (strings) to remove, and produces a Person without those names.
;; If a name in the list has ancestors, all their ancestors will be removed
;; as well.
;;
;; For example, here is a check-expect that should succeed. You should write
;; at least one more.
