;; Problem 5

;; You are running a car dealership, which seems to be a hot business these
;; days. Design data to represent a single vehicle in the dealership. You
;; need to track the vehicle's manufacturer (brand), the year it was made,
;; the price, whether or not it is new, and whether it is electric,
;; hybrid-electric, or runs on gasoline (petrol).


;; [TODO] Data design. Your examples should include new and used cars, all types 
;; of powertrains, and a variety of other reasonable values for other aspects of
;; a vehicle.
