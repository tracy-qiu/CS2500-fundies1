;; Problem 4

;; Consider the following data definition:

(define-struct person [name parent1 parent2])
;; A Person is one of:
;; - #false
;; - (make-person String Person Person)
;; Interpretation:  A person's name and two biological parents.
;; Or a sentinel value representing that a person's identity/lineage is not 
;; known.

(define (person-template p)
  (cond
    [(boolean? p) ...]
    [(person? p)
     (... (person-name p) ...
          (person-temp (person-parent1 p)) ...
          (person-temp (person-parent2 p)) ...)]))

(define PERSON-0 #false)
(define PERSON-1 (make-person "Alice" PERSON-0 PERSON-0))
(define PERSON-2 (make-person "Bob" PERSON-0 PERSON-0))
(define PERSON-3 (make-person "Carol" PERSON-1 PERSON-2))
(define PERSON-4 (make-person "David" PERSON-3 (make-person "Erin" PERSON-0 PERSON-0)))

;; Design a function called remove-ancestors that receives a Person and a
;; list of names (strings) to remove, and produces a Person without those names.
;; If a name in the list has ancestors, all their ancestors will be removed
;; as well.
;;
;; For example, here is a check-expect that should succeed. You should write
;; at least one more.

(check-expect
 (remove-ancestors PERSON-4 (list "Erin" "Bob"))
 (make-person "David" 
              (make-person "Carol" PERSON-1 #false)
              #false))
