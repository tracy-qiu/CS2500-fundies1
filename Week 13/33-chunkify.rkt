; Design the function gcd that accepts two positive integers and computes their
; greatest common divisor (the largest integer that cleanly divides them both).
; Let's use an insight from math called Euclid's algorithm:
; if we take (gcd L S) with L > S, then (gcd L S) = (gcd S (remainder L S)) â€“ until S=0.


; gcd : PositiveInteger PositiveInteger -> PositiveInteger
; Computes the GCD
; Termination: we're always recurring on something smaller
