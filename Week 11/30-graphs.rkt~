; All of the numbers in vertices are assumed to be unique and
; both inputs to the edges function are assumed to be
; valid vertices.

; Note: Below, we'll refer to inputs to the function in order as

; TODO #3: design the function adjacency-matrix that takes a graph and produces a
; matrix (a list of lists) where each row represents a vertex, each column also
; represents a vertex, and if (row, column) is a 1, then there is an edge from the
; vertex of the row to the vertex of the column.

; For example, G-3-1 would be represented as...

(define AM-3-1
  (list
   (list 0 1 0)
   (list 1 0 0)
   (list 0 0 0)))

; - row 1 (representing vertex 1): can only reach vertex 2 (via column 2)
; - row 2 (representing vertex 2): can only reach vertex 1 (via column 1)
