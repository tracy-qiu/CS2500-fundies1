;; Problem 2

;; This problem has a partially-completed data design for representing DNA
;; sequences. A DNA molecule is a long sequence of four nucleotides: adenine,
;; cytosine, guanine, and thymine. (More information here:
;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA.)

(define-struct adenine [rest])
(define-struct guanine [rest])
(define-struct cytosine [rest])
(define-struct thymine [rest])
;; A DNASeq is one of:
;; - (make-adenine DNASeq)
;; - (make-guanine DNASeq)
;; - (make-cytosine DNASeq)
;; - (make-thymine DNASeq)
;; - "empty sequence"
;; Interpretation: A DNASeq represents a sequence of nucleotides.

;; Part A

;; Write at least three examples of DNASeq. Across all examples, ensure you
;; have an example of all nucleotides.

;; As with Ts, Ts with As, Cs with Gs, and Gs with Cs. Design a function
;; to calculate the complement of a DNA sequence.
