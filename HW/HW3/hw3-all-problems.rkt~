;; Introduction

;; Spelling Bee is a vocabulary game hosted by the New York Times. The project
;; for this class is to build a program similar to Spelling Bee over the course
;; of several homework assignments. Before reading any further, you should play
;; the New York Times' Spelling Bee to understand the rules of the game:
;;
;; https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee
;;
;; Your first version of Spelling Bee, which you will design for this
;; assignment, will make several simplifications:
;;
;; 1. You will construct words using five letters, and not seven,
;; 2. You will be able to enter nonsensical words,
;; 3. You will not be able to correct mistakes (i.e., backspace will not
;;      work),
;; 4. You will be able enter the same word several times, and
;; 5. You won't keep score.
;;
;; In later homework, you will remove these restrictions.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; Step 1: Representing and Displaying Available Letters
;;

;; Design data called Letters that holds the five letters that are
;; available for your simplified Spelling Bee. Note that one of the letters is
;; distinguished as the required letter (i.e., the letter displayed at the
;; center).
;;
;; Tip: Use "1String" to refer to a one-character string in your data 
;; definition.

;; [TODO] Data design recipe


;; Design a function to display Letters as an Image. Feel free to layout the
;; letters in any way you like. However, the required letter must be
;; distinguished in some way (e.g., by position, color, font, etc).
;;
;; NOTE: You must not use substring in this function, or in any helper function
;; that it employs.

;; [TODO] Function design recipe


;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; Step 2: Representing the World

;; A game of Spelling Bee must track the available letters and the partial word
;; that the player has entered. Design data called World that holds
;; this data, and design a function called world->image that displays a World as
;; an image. You can produce any image that you like, but it should clearly show
;; both the available letters and the partial word.

;; Note: The final step of this homework has you revise the data definition for
;; World. We recommend completing this step before the revision. However, we
;; recommend you read the whole assignment first so that you can understand
;; the revision that you will have to do.

;; [TODO] Data design recipe

;; Step 3:  Player Interactions

;; In a game of Spelling Bee, the player can either enter a letter to add to the
;; current word, or press the "Enter" key to complete the word. Design a
;; function with the following signature:

;; key-pressed : World KeyEvent -> World

;; [TODO] Complete the function design recipe


;; When the key is an an available letter, key-pressed should produce a new
;; world that adds that letter to the end of the current word. If the key is not
;; an available letter, it should produce the previous world. If the key is the
;; special string "\r" (which stands for the Enter key), it should produce a new
;; world with the empty string for the current word, as long as the current word
;; contains the center letter. If the player presses any other key, produce the
;; previous world unchanged. In other words, your program should not produce an
;; error if the player presses the "wrong" key.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; Step 4: World Program

;; At this point, you have enough in place to play a basic game. Use the
;; following world program to play spelling bee.

;; play : World -> World
;;
;; Uses big-bang to play a game of Spelling Bee, given Letters.
(define (play w)
  (big-bang
      w
    (to-draw world->image)
    (on-key key-pressed)))

;; [TODO] Click Run. Then, in Interactions, use the function play on an 
;; example of Letters.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; Step 5: Keeping Track of Words

;; The Spelling Bee program that you have so far doesn't even keep track of the
;; words you've entered! We really need the game to show the words that
;; you've already entered. For example, if you previously entered the words
;; "bell" and "well", and the available letters are "b", "o", "w", "e", and "l",
;; with "l" at the center, the program should really display something that
;; looks like this:
;;
;;   O     Words so far:
;; B L W   bell
;;   E     well
;;
;; Here is how you can display text on multiple lines. In a string, the special
;; character "\n" represents a new line. So, the string
;; "Words so far:\nbell\nwell" represents a string that appears on three lines.
;;
;; Modify the data World to include the words so far, represented
;; as a string. You will also have modify the functions you've written so far.
;; But, if you carefully followed the design recipe, the changes will be minor.
;;
;; NOTE: Your program will show the words entered so far, but it will not
;; check that the player does not enter a duplicate word. We will address that
;; problem later.

;; [TODO] Modifications
