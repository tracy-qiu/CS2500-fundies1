;; Problem 8
;;
;; *This is a programming problem that you should do in DrRacket.*
;;
;; Consider the following data definition and interpretation:

(define-struct star [name mass])
(define-struct planet [name mass closer])
;; A SolarSystem is one of:
;; - (make-star String Number)
;; - (make-planet String Number SolarSystem)
;; Interpretation: A solar system has a star, and some number of planets
;; orbiting that star.
;; A SolarSystem is either:
;; - The star of a solar system, with its name and mass in Earth masses.
;;   (The mass of the Earth is 1 Earth mass.)
;; - A planet with name and mass (in Earth masses) that orbits farther
;;   than the portion of the solar system that is closer.

;; Part A

;; Write four examples of a SolarSystem. You do *not* have to get names of
;; planets or their masses correct. Feel free to make them up.

;; [TODO] Four examples


;; Part B

;; Write the template for a SolarSystem.

;; [TODO] Template


;; Part C

;; Design a function called solar-system-star-name
;; that produces the name of the star in a solar system.

;; [TODO] Function design
