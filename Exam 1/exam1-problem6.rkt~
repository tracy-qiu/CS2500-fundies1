;; Problem 6
;;
;; *This is a programming problem that you should do in DrRacket.*
;;
;; Consider the following data definition that represents the available letters
;; in a simplified game of Spelling Bee (identical to the project you've worked
;; on before).

(define-struct letters [center left right top bottom])
;; A Letters is a (make-letter 1String 1String 1String 1String 1String)
;; Interpretation: the letters available in a game of Spelling Bee:
;; - center: the letter at the center that must be used
;; - left, right, top, bottom: the four other letters

(define (letters-template l)
  (... (letters-center l) ...
       (letters-left l) ...
       (letters-right l) ...
       (letters-top l) ...
       (letters-bottom l) ...))

;; The letter "Q" is typically followed by the letter "U". So, it would be
;; very unfortunate if the available letters had a "Q" and *not* a "U".
;; Design a function that produces #false when a Letters has a "Q" but
;; omits a "U".

;; Ensure you follow the complete function design recipe, including for any
;; appropriate helper functions you may choose to write.

;; [TODO] Function design
