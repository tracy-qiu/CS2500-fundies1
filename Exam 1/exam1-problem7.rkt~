;; Problem 7
;;
;; *This is a programming problem that you should do in DrRacket.*
;;
;; You have been tasked with building a web-based takeout menu for a pizzeria.
;; The pizzeria sells pizzas and soft drinks. Every pizza has a name
;; (e.g., "margherita" or "pepperoni"), and size (small, medium, or large).
;; Soft drinks only have a name (e.g., "Pepsi" or "Harmony Springs Cola").
;;
;; Design a data definition that represents a single menu item for the pizzeria.
;; Ensure you follow the entire data design recipe for all data that you design.

;; [TODO] Data designs
